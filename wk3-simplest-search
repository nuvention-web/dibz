# The Simplest Item Searching Interface Possible
# 19 January 2016

## Save each item into a list, thereby mimicking a database
items = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in open('search-items.txt')]
#print(items)

search_item = input("What are you looking for?    ")
found = search_item in items

if found == True:
	print("Your item has been found!")

elif found == False:
	print("Your item has not been found. Look out for a notification from Dibz when ")
	print(search_item + " becomes available.")
