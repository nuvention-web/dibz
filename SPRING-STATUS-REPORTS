Dibz Spring Quarter Status Reports

We apologize in advance for not doing pull requests for weeks 1-3 this quarter, but we wanted to update the TAs and staff with our
progress thus far. As of week 3, we had:

+ Created a new logo
+ Changed Dibz into a seller dashboard/item listing hub
+ Performed market research and interviews broader than the Northwestern community
+ Changed the Dibz UI (HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery)
+ Validated and stored usernames, passwords, and email addresses

In the upcoming weeks, we want to:

+ Personalize Dibz to each Dibz account (i.e. once user is logged in, give them access to features)
+ Incorporate Bitly API for link generation and shortening services
+ Make image upload into database functional
+ Generalize web pages so they work for more than ~30-50 items per seller
