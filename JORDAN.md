### Jordan's List
- In item.tag, check out the function called "imgAppear". It is supposed to change the src attribute of the img tag such that the stored image will appear, but it is not even being entered.
- listings.tag (?) or some related file is causing items to appear multiple times after being added. This goes away upon hard-refreshing the page, but it shouldn't happen in the first place.
- listings.tag (?) or some related file is showing a blank template for an item even when no items are present in the database.
